# Mapping_Earthquakes
Creating interactive maps using GeoJSON data.


## Resource 
- Javascript, HTML, VS Code 1.51.1
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.


## The Map 
The interactive map has been designed to have a toggle where you can switch map views (street, satelite, dark). You can also choose which levels of data you would like to be displayed by turning the selection on and off. 
The available data views are the following: 
  - All Earthquakes: Displays all earthquake data 
  - Tectonic plate outline: provides a visual of the earth's tectonic plates
